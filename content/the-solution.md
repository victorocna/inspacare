The unique patented design of the Inspacare GloveSafe reduces waste and contamination:

- Compels the use of pincer grasp through a unique filter, allowing only one glove to be removed at a time
- Promotes cognitive awareness to not simply grab excess gloves
- Employs a half-cylindrical safety ledge which minimizes excess gloves falling on the floor
