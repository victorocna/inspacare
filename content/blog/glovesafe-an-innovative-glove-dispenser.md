The Inspacare GloveSafe is an easy to use glove dispensing system aimed at reducing waste and contamination. <!--more-->

## For every two pairs of gloves used in clinical settings, one gets wasted due to contamination

The unique patented design of the lnspacare Glove Dispenser reduces waste and minimizes risk of contamination by

- Compelling the use of a proper pincer grasp allowing only one glove to be removed at a time
- Promoting cognitive awareness of users to not simply grab excess gloves
- Employing a custom designed safety ledge that minimizes "clumps" from falling out and prevents gloves from falling to floor
